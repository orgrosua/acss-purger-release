== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does it work with Bricks Builder and Oxygen Builder?**

ACSS Purger works with Bricks Builder and Oxygen Builder.

**How does ACSS Purger manage the CSS file?**

ACSS Purger will copy your original CSS file into a different folder and purge the copy. When you visit your site as a guest, ACSS Purger will replace the original CSS URL with a purged CSS URL.

If you have the cache system activated, try to clear the cache to see the result immediately.

**What made it different from the "Pro Mode" introduced on ACSS 2.3?**

ACSS Purger allows you to cherry-pick the classes you want, while "Pro Mode" doesn't allow you to use any classes from disabled categories.

Pro Mode is a feature that deactivates most of the classes while retaining the use of variables to allow you to reduce the ACSS framework CSS file.

With "Pro Mode", you are limiting yourself from the beginning by reducing the number of classes you can use.

ACSS Purger will give you an alternative workflow: use any classes, then purge later (automatically) the CSS file. This workflow gives you more freedom in a cheaper way to use any classes while still lightening the ACSS framework by over 50%.

**What if I want to use the classes that are purged?**

When logged as Admin or editing inside Bricks editor and Oxygen editor, you are loading the original CSS file, allowing you to use any classes.

Once you save your edit on the Bricks or Oxygen editor, ACSS Purger will run in the background and purge the CSS file based on your recent edits.

**What if I want to exclude some classes from being purged?**

You can add the classes to the safelist. The safelist is a list of classes that will be excluded from being purged.
